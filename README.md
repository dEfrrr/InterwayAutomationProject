Interway Automation Project - Dimitar Efremovski

This project represents my first experience with unit testing and integration testing using Spring Boot.  
I am actively learning how to write and execute effective tests to ensure the application's reliability and correctness.  
Many of the unit and integration tests were developed with the assistance of ChatGPT, which was a valuable learning tool throughout the process.  
I enjoyed working on this project and appreciate the opportunity to enhance my testing skills.
