Interway Automation Project - Dimitar Efremovski

This is my first time working with unit testing in Spring Boot and integration testing overall.
I'm learning how to write and run tests to ensure the application works as expected, so for most of the unit and integration tests I used ChatGPT.
Had fun working on this project so thank you for the experience!
